# GMM

I am currently working on Gaussian mixture models with Rmixmod package that has been developped by MODAL team (INRIA Lille). These are few examples where i use common datasets to test the package and make comparison with Mclust package. 

Rmixmod is a very powerful tool but lacks documentation (e.g lots of functions are not clearly explained ).

The goal is to create a python version of Rmixmod (Pymixmod is poorly developped with bug issues when installing) and developp our own application based on Rmixmod that will be made more innovative.****
